# Freightman

### Vision

Developing a solution for the businesses who are operating specially in Transportation or Freight Carriers. 

## Who is involved in the process?

There are basically 3 actors in this whole scenario.

1. Administrator (Truck Organization Owner)
2. Driver (Truck Driver who will be carrying the carrier)
3. Client (Can be anyone who's carrier/freight needs to be transported.)

### How it works?

The Administrator will be able to assign, track and receive the business enquires. He'll not be limited to only tracking the drivers's location and the status. 

He'll also be receiving the client requests or new enquiries. As of now, assumption is that the client will be making a request from his/her mobile application or web client. Once, the adminstrator approves it, depending on the situation he sees, a notification will be sent to the client stating that the request has been approved and will be further asked to share the details of the carrier like: Weight, Type, Height, Shape, Current Location, Desired Location etc. 

Once, the details are being received back to the Adminstrator, he'll send a quotation in local currency and local language and will ask for the approval from client. 

If the client approves the quotation, he'll be further asked for the GST number and the business details from the client along with the payment options he'd be interested in.
